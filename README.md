## Code Repository for Multilevel PPO Experiments

Welcome to the code repository dedicated to conducting experiments with the Multilevel Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. For a comprehensive understanding of the multilevel PPO algorithm, please consult the associated [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08400).

Within this repository, we present two distinct case studies that revolve around multilevel environments. The intricate details encompassing the design and execution of these case studies can be found in the following directories:

1. `case_1/`: Referred to as the `ResSim_v1 experiments` in the corresponding [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08400).
2. `case_2/`: Referred to as the `ResSim_v2 experiments` as outlined in the same [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08400).

To explore the outcomes generated by the Multilevel PPO algorithm, we offer dedicated repositories for visualization:

- `case_1/data_viz` (pertaining to ResSim_v1)
- `case_2/data_viz` (pertaining to ResSim_v2)

Feel free to navigate through these directories to delve into the specifics of each case study and visualize the results yielded by the application of the Multilevel PPO algorithm.
